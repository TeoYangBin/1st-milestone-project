UX


My goal of the design was to make it simple as straigt forward

For clients, i wanted to provide them with a simple overview of our service.
In this way they will be able to get what kind of service we are providing.
simplfied and main terms and condition will be mention to protect both side. 
Contact method will be provided for client to enqury and order the service.

User Stories
In the busy society and work load increases,
a person have much more important things to focus to support his or her family and company, 
so he or she had to outsource some of the work to third party. 
Cleaning is important but it is general work and it would not involve any P&C works.
So they seeks cleaning service provider to help out and keep thier area clean.
